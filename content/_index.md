## About this site
The majority of Austinies believe in the reality of man-made climate change. They know they need to change their lives drastically, but they don't know how to start.

Paris has transformed their city with hundreds of miles of dedicated bike paths. The goal is to make Paris a 100% cycling city. 

Austin could become a 100% cycling city as well. **Transforming into Paris on the Colorado.**

But how do we do that? How do we change our neighborhoods? How do we bring people from the suburbs into the city?

This site is not a plan. It's meant to be a place to detail what exists and dream about what can be.
