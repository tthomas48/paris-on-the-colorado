## Ideas
* Allow small business on the trail. Things like small convenience stores, popsicle stands, and taco trucks.
  TODO: Move this into a more general idea
* Add picnic tables and public restrooms to the trail at regular intervals. Allow HOAs and other neighborhood groups to sponsor different table types in a similar manner to the downtown austin alliance.
