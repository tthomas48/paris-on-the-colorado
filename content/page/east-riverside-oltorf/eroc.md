# A starting point
East Riverside/Oltorf is one of the densest and most populous neighborhoods in Austin. 

**QUESTION: Should there be sections for neighborhoods or does that make it too difficult?**


## Active Transportation
* It has an existing car-free spine in the [Country Club Creek Trail]({{<ref "ccctrail">}})
* It has car-free spurs to other parts of the city - The Hike and Bike Trail, Colorado River Dam, [Monotopolis Truss Bridge]({{<ref "montopolis-truss-bridge">}}), and Bergstrom Spur
* It has dense housing with a large car-free or car-light population

## Coming soon
* Completion of the [Country Club Creek Trail]({{<ref "ccctrail">}}) between Oltorf and East Riverside with an underpass under Riverside.

## Questions
* How do we connect East/West to the spur?
* How do we better cross Oltorf and Riverside?
* How do we get better protected facilities?
* How do we start taking lanes?
* How do we start closing neighborhood streets to only local automotive traffic?

### Next Steps
* With the current plan for IH-35 Woodland will no longer go under the freeway and there will only be a pedestrian and bike connection. This will drastically reduce automobile traffic on Woodland and creates a situation for Woodland to become the primary bicycle East/West connection to the Country Club Creek Trail. Although it will need to somehow connect with the Country Club Creek Trail. 

## Transit
* It's served well by transit today, and will have the [light rail]({{<ref "lightrail">}}) and the [Pleasant Valley Metro Rapid]({{<ref "metrorapid">}}) line in the future

## Suburban Connections
* Gateway to [Del Valle]({{<ref "delvalle">}})
* McKinney Falls
* Goodnight Ranch
* Easton Park

## Parks
* Guerrero Park
* Mabel Davis Regional Park

## Park Connections

## Regional Connections
* Connections to Dallas, Houston, the Valley, Oklahoma, and Mexico via the [Eastside Plaza Greyhound Bus Station]({{<ref "montopolis-truss-bridge">}})
